# Student application

#### Requirements

System UI can be written using any framework you are familiar with, but It must allow the user to select a text file with student data, sorting algorithm and display the result in a table with an option to save it to a file. As we are not sure how many students will have to be sorted, we would like you to implement Bubble, Heap and Merge sorting algorithms, but enable system design to be easily extendable in future. To simplify benchmarking we would like to see a number of records and sorting time.

#### Technology stack

- Java 17
- Maven 
- JavaFX
- ...

#### How to launch

If you have JDK and JavaFX:
1. Launch Application class main method in your IDE.

If you have JDK but no JavafX:
1. Launch student-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar file which you can find here: https://github.com/mantas462/student/tree/master/JAR%20FILE

If you do not have JDK nor JavaFX
1. Send me an email and I will send you the installation of the program or zipped file with the needed files because GitHub does not allow to upload large files.


#### Description of the program

If you want to import a file into the program, please click the 'Select file' button.
If you want to save an existing list to a file, please click the 'Save file' button.
If you want to sort the existing list in the program, please select the desired sorting method from the drop-down menu.
After sorting, the time taken by the algorithm will be displayed in an alert pop-up window.

#### Example input
Student1,8.5
Student2,6.5
Student3,5.0
